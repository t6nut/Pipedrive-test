# Test task for front end developer

## Information

This test task contains different areas which are part of Pipedrive’s front
end developer’s daily job. Doing this job will show candidate’s: 1) speed and
ability learn new things; 2) thinking about the code in a modular way; 3) the
level of creativity in visual design; 4) ability to understand and follow
Pipedrive’s visual style.

Technically this task involves using Backbone.js framework which is used in
Pipedrive’s web application, using Developer’s documentation and using the
public AJAX API’s to create a real living test page.

## The app

The app consists of navigation, sidebar and main area. Most important areas
are of course sidebar and main area. In the sidebar a list of profiles is
pulled over the API. Clicking on the sidebar item displays more detailed
profile information in the main area and lists deals related with the user.
This information is also pulled dynamically over the API.
All the data in this test task is used purely as read-only. No edit functio-
nality is required.
Every profile has their own unique URL so that it is accessible when copy-
pasting the links. The page is fully dynamic which means, the page should not
be reloaded within this scope.
Deviation from the scope is ok, as long as it’s justified and thinking out of
the box is definitely a plus!

## Technical requirements

1. Backbone.js library must be used (http://backbonejs.org/)
2. Application must use Pipedrive’s public API’s
   (https://developers.pipedrive.com/v1)
3. API token can be hard coded for the sake of this excercise
